# graphPef

This program shall help students of Faculty of Business of Mendel University in Brno to achieve better results and understanding of subjectc.

## Microecnomics
In next chapters app implementatin will be described and how it shall help students.
### Session 2
Seminar theme: Production limit

There shall be graph which shows production limit(PPF) and how it changes: 
1. when resources are operated better(upButton) and worse(downButton)
2. when one of production gets better production process(//TODO)

### Session 3
Seminar theme: Perfect competiotion market

Graph of perfect competition market to be shown with DEMAND and SUPPLY curve. Both D and S curve shall be movable up(upButton) and down(downButton)

>Based on intersection EQUILIBRIUM(futherly stated as EQ) is calculated and lines from axis are made. Text showing EQ Quantity and price to be shown as text.

> D : Q = f (P) f(x) = - x + 10  

> S : Q = f (P) f(x) = x + 10

option to add:

>price limit of market
>  -show if intersection is on market prace and therefore if situaion is stable

### Session 4
Seminar theme: Indifferent analysis

Indifferent curve(IC) and marginal rate of substitution(MRS) shall be shown
> IC = Qx / Qy

> MRS = Px / Py

//TODO

### Session 5-7
Seminar theme: Perfect Market

Curves to be shown:
- Average Costs (AC)
- Marginal Costs (MC)
- Average Variable Costs (AVC)
- Marginal Revenue (MR)
- Average Revenue (AR)
- product Demand (d)
- product Price (p)

text output:
- if stable situaion long-term
- if stable situaion short-term
- value of AVC in EQ
- value of AFC (average fixed costs) in EQ
- if operational
- if allocation effective
- if production effective

option to move:
- price of product (MR,AR,p,d)
- costs (AC,AVC,MC dependant on themselves move together)

options to be shown:

show with color 
- FC + VC
- profit/loss
